## Introduction

Understanding the protocols that govern web communication is essential for anyone working with the internet. HTTP, HTTPS, and DNS play crucial roles in enabling the functionality and security of the World Wide Web.

## HTTP

- **Definition:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol, a protocol used for transmitting hypertext over the internet.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Request-Response Cycle
  - Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Status Codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
- **Usage:** Retrieving web pages, data submission, and more.

## HTTPS

- **Definition:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, a secure version of HTTP.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - SSL/TLS Encryption
  - Certificate Authority (CA)
  - HTTPS Port (443)
- **Importance:** Ensures secure and encrypted communication over the internet, especially for sensitive data like login credentials.

## DNS

- **Definition:** Domain Name System, a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Domain Names and IP Addresses
  - DNS Resolution Process
  - Name Servers
- **Functionality:** Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, facilitating internet communication.
